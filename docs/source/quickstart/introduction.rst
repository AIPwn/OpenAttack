Introduction
====================

OpenAttack is an open-source Python-based textual adversarial attack toolkit, 
which handles the whole process of textual adversarial attacking, including 
preprocessing text, accessing the victim model, generating adversarial examples 
and evaluation.

Uses
------------------
OpenAttack has a wide range of uses, including:

1. Providing various handy baselines for attack models;
2. Comprehensively evaluating attack models using its thorough evaluation metrics;
3. Assisting in quick development of new attack models with the help of its common attack components;
4. Evaluating the robustness of a machine learning model against various adversarial attacks;
5. Conducting adversarial training to improve robustness of a machine learning model by enriching the training data with generated adversarial examples.
